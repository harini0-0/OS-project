The congestion of urban traffic is one of the critical issues of the present day. 
It has become a necessity to design and develop an efficient traffic management system as traffic congestion is causing various problems in many cities across the world. 
There are various drawbacks in the existing traffic management systems. The current Traffic Signal controllers are static, which means they allocate green signal to the roads in a predetermined order, for a constant time irrespective of number of vehicles present on the road. This leads to few roads getting red signal for more time than required, therefore causes unwanted delays and increase in traffic. Hence there is a need to develop an adaptive traffic light controller which efficiently allocates green signal to selected road for appropriate time based on the current traffic density of the road. Similarly there is no proper mechanism to prevent further crowding on already congested roads. If drivers are provided with least congested paths to their destinations based on latest real time traffic conditions, then they can utilise these optimum paths and therefore avoid crowded roads and hence prevent further congestion on these roads. 
Hence we aim to develop a Smart Traffic Management System that overcomes the above mentioned drawbacks, therefore reducing fuel consumption and pollution. <br><br>
The project has been divided into 2 module:
a) Central management system which focuses on regulating congestions in city by navigating the user through the least congested path.<br>
b) Smart traffic light system which focuses on dynamically allocating the traffic signal time to each lane based on the number of vehicles in their respective lane.<br>
